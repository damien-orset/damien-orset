# My mission

- Airbus (Protospace): Computer vision and Transfer Learning - Training of a model and creation of an application to identify laser-marked characters on small diameter cables (1-2mm)
- PSA Banque: Machine Learning – Training of a binary classification model (supervised learning) to predict the renewing nature of a bank customer with respect to a car loan
- Internal subject: Learning reinforcement for smart city traffic - Training of an AI by RL (Dueling Double DQN) to act on traffic lights and make traffic as smooth as possible. Use of an open source urban simulator.
- Pôle Emploi: AutoML (self learning) – Identification of signatures in attendance sheets.
- Pôle Emploi: instant translation of lyrics from one language to another (spech2text in one language + translate + text2speech in another language)
